#### The open approaches that are relevant and appropriate for your specific disciplinary context may vary. Click the links for an overview of each practice and a basic template that can be adapted for your proposal.


The basic principles of open science, research and scholarship are listed below. See [open science template text](https://handbook.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/open-research/open-science-template/) for more detailed guidance on each item:

* make publications available open access
* make underlying data relating to publications openly available wherever possible
* where data cannot be fully open, it should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
* share protocols and methodologies
* share software and code
* share negative results to prevent unnecessary repetition of research
* establish rights for (archival) source material to be digitised and shared where possible
* apply appropriate licences to your open material eg Creative Commons
* use persistent identifiers consistently throughout your workflow eg DOI and ORCID
* exploit online tools to aid collaboration including blogging, social media, altmetrics, pre-print servers
* consider 'citizen science' approaches where appropriate.
