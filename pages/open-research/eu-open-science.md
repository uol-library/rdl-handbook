## Horizon Europe Programme - Research Data Management and open research
## This page is to help you consider Research Data Management considerations and potential open research practices for your Horizon Europe Pprogramme proposal
### Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships (HE MSCA PF)
#### Project proposal – Technical description (Part B)
#### Version 1.0
#### 18 June 2021
#### (pg 4)
> 1.2 Soundness of the proposed methodology (including interdisciplinary approaches, consideration of the gender dimension and other diversity aspects if relevant for the research project, 
> and the quality of open science practices, including sharing and management of research outputs and engagement of citizens, civil society and end users, where appropriate)

The terms open science, open research and open scholarship are often used interchangably and encompasses the entire research process, to make all aspects of the research cycle accessible. This extends the established ways to share your research of making publications open access and making the underlying data available.

Research should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Some research outputs cannot be openly available due to ethical, legal or commercial restrictions.

#### The open approaches that are relevant and appropriate for your specific disciplinary context may vary. Click the links for an overview of each practice and a basic template that can be adapted for your proposal.

The basic principles of open science, research and scholarship are to:

* make publications available open access
* make underlying data relating to publications openly available wherever possible
* where data cannot be fully open, it should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
* share protocols and methodologies
* share software and code
* share negative results to prevent unnecessary repetition of research
* establish rights for (archival) source material to be digitised and shared where possible
* apply appropriate licences to your open material eg Creative Commons
* use persistent identifiers consistently throughout your workflow eg DOI and ORCID
* exploit online tools to aid collaboration including blogging, social media, altmetrics, pre-print servers
* consider 'citizen science' approaches where appropriate.
