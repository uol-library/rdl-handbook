### Completing the "Research data management and management of other research outputs" section

If you are **generating or reusing research data**, submit a “Research data management and management of other research outputs” plan of no more than **1 page** addressing your approach to data management, including open science practices. Always check any specific requirements for the call you are applying to.

Make sure your data plan is consistent with information provided elsewhere in your bid, including your ethics self-assessment and any plans you have outlined for management of intellectual property. 

Use your Research Data Management plan to demonstrate:
1. Your approach to data is consistent with the FAIR principles. That means your data and other associated materials are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. 
2. Your data will be shared openly unless there are legitimate reasons to restrict access to it. You are demonstrating that your data is “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.

## Research data management and management of other research outputs plan
### 1. Types of data / research outputs
Describe data you will generate and any pre-existing data you will reuse. Estimate data volume. If you plan to use third party data, give details of where you will source if from and how it related to the data you will generate. 
Data is only valuable if it can be understood. Will there be tools or instruments needed to reuse the research data (e.g. software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks)? Briefly describe these. 
### 2. Findability of data/research outputs
State where you will deposit your data and associated materials. Some (but not all) EU calls specify you must use a repository federated in European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). There is a [list of federated data repositories](https://eosc-portal.eu/) on the EOSC portal. Some calls simply require the data is deposited in any ‘trusted repository’ – in this case, you can choose any service that meets the EU’s criteria ([as specified in the Annotated Model Grant Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/aga_en.pdf)), such as the University of Leeds research data repository, Research Data Leeds. Further advice on [choosing a repository](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/14062/research_data_management/66/sharing_data/3) is available on the Research Data Leeds website.
#### Suggested text:
“Data and associated materials will be deposited in the University of Leeds Research Data Leeds repository with contextual documentation to aid reuse. Datasets will be given Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)”
### 3. Accessibility of data/research outputs
Can you make your research data and associated materials openly available? Remember, not all data has to be treated in the same way. You could release some data openly but place access controls on other data, so long as there is a justification to do so. As well as research data, you should say whether associated materials will be available. Explain what will be released, how open it will be and whether it will be released straight away or after a period of time.
#### Suggested text:
“[*describe data*] and associated materials will made openly available during the research project. [*describe data*] cannot be openly released because [*give reason*]. Metadata about all data will be openly released, including details of how to apply for restricted access data.”

"Restricted access data will be deposited in the Restricted Access Data Repository (RADAR) which is part of the Research Data Leeds service. Data access will be subject to a Data Sharing Agreement addressing what can and cannot be done with the data.” *If you plan to deposit restricted access data in Research Data Leeds please check with the service first to make sure your data can be accommodated* (email: <researchdataenquiries@leeds.ac.uk>).
### 4. Interoperability of data/research outputs
If you plan to deposit in the Research Data Leeds repository, you can use the suggested text. If you are deposited in a different repository or data service, check which standards or vocabularies are used and describe them here. Check any suggested or required file formats. Use open file formats where you can.
#### Suggested text:
“Data deposited with Research Data Leeds will be described using the Dublin Core and DataCite metadata schemas. Open file formats will be used, where possible.”
### 5. Reusability of data/research outputs
How will you make sure it is clear how the data or other material (e.g. code) can be reused? The EU often mentions Creative Commons licences but other open licences are available. CC can be appropriate for data but are not the best option for software source code (code licence options are listed on the [Open Source Initiative website](https://opensource.org/licenses). 
#### Suggested text:
“Data and associated materials will be released under an open licence, such as the Creative Commons CC-BY licence”.
“Code will be released under an appropriate open licence for software.” 
### 6. Curation and storage/preservation costs
State who will be responsible for collecting, organising and depositing data and any quality control measures you will put in place. Do you have access to sufficient storage for your data? Are you handling very sensitive data? Two important considerations:
1. Costs for [additional storage](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0013189) (if in doubt, contact IT)
2. If your data is very sensitive (e.g. NHS data) and needs to be stored securely on [LASER (Leeds Analytic Secure Environment for Research)](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/about-lida/integrated-research-campus/), it is **important** to discuss your project requirements with the LASER team and build costs into your budget. Email <dat@leeds.ac.uk>

#### Suggested text:
(If you have basic storage requirements which can be accommodated on standard University infrastructure)

"All materials will be stored on fully backed up University storage. Data stored on portable devices will be transferred to University provisioned storage as soon as is practicable."

"Data deposited with the Research Data Leeds repository will be retained for a minimum of 10 years; data of long-term value will be retained indefinitely."

## Post award
If your application is successful, you will need to submit [a full data management plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan-template_he_en.docx) within the first six months of your project and update the plan regularly.
