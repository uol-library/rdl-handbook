## Horizon Europe Programme - Research Data Management and open research
## This page is to help you consider Research Data Management considerations and potential open research practices for your Horizon Europe Pprogramme proposal
#### Standard Application Form (HE RIA, IA) [Example, not to complete]
#### Version 1.1 
#### 19 April 2021
> Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementation are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives (e.g. 1 page). If you believe that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justification here. 

#### Research Data Management (RDM)
> Research data management and management of other research outputs: Applicants generating/collecting data and/or other research outputs (except for publications) during the project must provide maximum 1 page on how the data/ research outputs will be managed in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), addressing the following (the description should be specific to your project)
#### Open science
> Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, preprints, or crowd-sourcing); research output management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workflows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).
