##### 1. Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology 
##### 2. Describe how the choice of practices are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives

### Mandatory open science practices 

#### 1. open access to scientific publications under the conditions required by the grant agreement

**Criteria:**

•	by the time of publication, **a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version**

#### OR 

•	the **final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication** is deposited in a repository and immediately available open access under [Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC-BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

•	for **monographs and other long-text formats**, the licence may exclude commercial uses and derivative works (e.g. [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)) 

•	authors must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the open access requirements.

• Only publication fees in full open access venues for peer-reviewed scientific publications are eligible for reimbursement.

##### Suggested text:
"The authors' accepted manuscript (AAM) will be deposited into the White Rose repository on acceptance for publication. This will apply to both fully OA journals and for subscription and hybrid journals. For subscription and hybrid venues, during submission we will include a statement advising the publisher that **'This research was funded, in whole or in part, by the Horizon Europe Programme [grant number]. For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a CC-BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version arising from this submission'.**


#### 2.	responsible management of research data in line with the FAIR principles and open access to research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’

* If you are generating or reusing research data, you can include a data management plan of up to 1 page in your application. See [RDM template text](https://handbook.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/open-research/rdm-template/)


#### 3.	information about the research outputs/tools/instruments needed to validate the conclusions of scientific publications or to validate/re-use research data. 

“All our research outputs including data, code and methodology will be made available to fully rerun analyses. This will ensure the transparency of our research methods and help ensure that other researchers can validate the results.” 

**Note: The specific material you will need to share depends on the nature of your research and will require academic judgement. It may include documentation of proprietary software, tools and instruments. Simply stating that data or code is available on request is insufficient.**

Always read the call: **Some open science practices are mandatory per specific work programmes or call conditions.**

### Recommended open science practices

#### Early and open sharing 
Provide specific information on whether and how you will implement early and open sharing and for which part of your expected output. What type of early and open sharing is appropriate for your discipline and project? 
##### Preprints
##### Preregistration
##### Registered reports

#### Reproducibility of research outputs

##### transparent research design
##### robustness of statistical analyses
##### addressing negative results
