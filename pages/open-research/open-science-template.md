### Completing the "Research data management and management of other research outputs" section

In addition to your approach to data managemet, your “Research data management and management of other research outputs” plan of no more than **1 page** should address which open science practices you will be implementing as an integral part of your methodology. Always check any specific requirements for the call you are applying to.

Make sure your plan is consistent with information provided elsewhere in your bid, including your ethics self-assessment and any plans you have outlined for management of intellectual property. 

Use your plan to demonstrate:
1. Your approach to data is consistent with the FAIR principles. That means your data and other associated materials are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. 
2. Your data will be shared openly unless there are legitimate reasons to restrict access to it. You are demonstrating that your data is “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.
3. Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented and how the choice of practices are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives. 

**If you believe that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justification here.**


make publications available open access

make underlying data relating to publications openly available wherever possible

where data cannot be fully open, it should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

share protocols and methodologies

share software and code

share negative results to prevent unnecessary repetition of research

establish rights for (archival) source material to be digitised and shared where possible

apply appropriate licences to your open material eg Creative Commons

use persistent identifiers consistently throughout your workflow eg DOI and ORCID

exploit online tools to aid collaboration including blogging, social media, altmetrics, pre-print servers

consider ‘citizen science’ approaches where appropriate.
