### Trusted Repository status

**Trusted repositories are:**
Certified repositories (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, nestor Seal DIN31644, ISO16363) or disciplinary and domain repositories commonly used and endorsed by the research communities. Such repositories should be recognised internationally.

General-purpose repositories or institutional repositories that present the essential characteristics of trusted repositories:

* organisational, technical and procedural quality to maintain integrity and authenticity of contents
* provide access to content free at point of use / respecting legal and ethical limitations as appropriate
* assigns persistent unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs)
* maintains high quality metadata to enable discovery, reuse and citation, including provenance and licensing information
* facilitate mid- and long-term preservation of material
* have provisions for expert curation and quality assurance for accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata
* meet accepted (inter)national criteria for security to prevent unauthorized access and release of content 
* have different levels of security depending on the sensitivity of deposited data 

**Please note that, while the Research Data Leeds repository does not currently hold formal certification, it meets all these criteria.
