ESRC expect data associated with ESRC funded research to be deposited with an appropriate repository within 3 months of the end of the funded project. Although there is some flexibility about where you deposit the data, we recommend you use the ReShare data repository which is managed by the UK Data Service on behalf of the ESRC.  

You should: 
 
1. Read the data management plan for your project. What commitments were made about sharing the data? 
2. Make sure your approach to sharing data is consistent with the wording of your consent forms and participant information.  

ReShare can handle data which is openly available and data which requires restricted access. For interviews, even anonymised, it’s likely you’ll need to apply restrictions ('safeguards') to the data rather than sharing them openly. 
 
Information about the ReShare repository, including a video on how to deposit data (which I suggest you watch), is available online:  

<http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/>
 
You’ll also need to look at the information about preparing your data for deposit:

If you have questions you can [seek help directly from the UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/get-in-touch.aspx) or you can (contact us)[mailto:{{ site.contact.email }}] and we’ll be happy to help if we can. 
 
If you deposit data with ReShare we suggest you create a data record in the Symplectic system at Leeds so that your dataset is registered against your profile at the University (or contact us and we will create the entry for you).
