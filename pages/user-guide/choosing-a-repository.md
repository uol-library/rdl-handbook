## Is your data already in another repository?

If your data is already available in the UK Data Service, there is no need to deposit it again with the Research Data Leeds repository. Make sure there is a citation to the data in the UK Data Service in your paper References list.

## Repository for code 

You can choose where to deposit, but we suggest that you choose a repository that can give you a permanent, unique and resolvable identifier (like a DOI) for your code. We generally advise [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) because it has a relationship with the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/) which will assign a DOI for your code. The DOI (or other permanent link) makes the code more readily citable:

<https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/>
 
We can then include the DOI (or other link) to the code in the [thesis record in White Rose Etheses Online] [dataset record] so that anyone finding your data /reading your thesis has an easy link to the code in GitHub/Zenodo (or wherever you have deposited). 
 
You should consider what licence you will apply to your code. If we make code available in one of our Leeds repositories, such as the research data repository, we generally use an MIT Licence which is a very open, liberal licence <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT> - but the choice of licence is yours. 

## NERC 

Data from NERC funded projects should be offered to a NERC data centre in the first instance. NERC take most of the data - though there has been at least one datasets with multiple funders and from a none core subject area where NERC have been happy for the data to come to RDL. 

Environmental data which is not NERC funded - NERC will consider taking it but will weigh up the size and the complexity of adding the data to their collection. If in doubt, contact the relevant NERC data centre or email the data centre coordinator (data@nerc.ukri.org)[mailto:data@nerc.ukri.org]
