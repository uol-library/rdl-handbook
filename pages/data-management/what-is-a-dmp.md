A Data Management Plan (DMP) is written in the early stages of the research project to establish good research practice in data management.  This will better ensure the proposed research is carried out as efficiently as possible, throughout the projectâ€™s lifetime and post project. The DMP will describe how the researcher(s) will collect, organise, analyse, preserve and share the data generated from their research.

All Research / Projects at the University of Leeds should have a Data Management Plan (DMP) in accordance with the [Research Data Management Policy](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/14062/research_data_management/68/research_data_management_policy) and the assurance given at **Section 1.4 of your Ethical Review Application Form**.

Once you have drafted a DMP, the Research Data Management Service at the University would be very happy to provide feedback on your DMP should you require this. Please email: [researchdataenquiries@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:researchdataenquiries@leeds.ac.uk).

## The data management plan will explain: 

1. **[Data Collection]({% link pages/data-management/data-collection.md %})** - what data will be collected, how will it be collected, and how will it complement existing data?
   * What type, format and volume of data?
   * Do your chosen formats and software enable sharing and long-term access to the data?
   * Are there any existing data that you can reuse?
   * What standards or methodologies will you use?
   * How will you structure and name your folders and files?
   * How will you handle versioning?
   * What quality assurance processes will you adopt?
2. **[Documentation and Metadata]({% link pages/data-management/documentation-and-metadata.md %})** - what data types, formats, standards and capture methods will be used?
   * What information is needed for the data to be to be read and interpreted in the future?
   * How will you capture / create this documentation and metadata?
   * What metadata standards will you use and why?
3. **[Ethics and Legal Compliance]({% link pages/data-management/ethics-and-legal-compliance.md %})** - how will the data comply with copyright, data protection, confidentiality, and consent requirements?
   * Have you gained consent for data preservation and sharing?
   * How will you protect the identity of participants if required? e.g. via anonymisation
   * How will sensitive data be handled to ensure it is stored and transferred securely?
   * Who owns the data?
   * How will the data be licensed for reuse?
   * Are there any restrictions on the reuse of third-party data?
   * Will data sharing be postponed / restricted e.g. to publish or seek patents?
4. **[Storage and Backup]({% link pages/data-management/storage-and-backup.md %})** - how will the data be stored in the short-term and long-term?
   * Do you have sufficient storage or will you need to include charges for additional services?
   * How will the data be backed up?
   * Who will be responsible for backup and recovery?
   * How will the data be recovered in the event of an incident?
   * What are the risks to data security and how will these be managed?
   * How will you control access to keep the data secure?
   * How will you ensure that collaborators can access your data securely?
   * If creating or collecting data in the field how will you ensure its safe transfer into your main secured systems?
5. **[Seclection and Preservation]({% link pages/data-management/selection-and-preservation.md %})** - how will data be secured and who will have access?
   * What data must be retained/destroyed for contractual, legal, or regulatory purposes?
   * How will you decide what other data to keep?
   * What are the foreseeable research uses for the data?
   * How long will the data be retained and preserved?
   * Where e.g. in which repository or archive will the data be held?
   * What costs if any will your selected data repository or archive charge?
   * Have you costed in time and effort to prepare the data for sharing / preservation?
6. **[Data Sharing]({% link pages/data-management/data-sharing.md %})** - how will data be shared outside the core project staff and what reuse opportunities are there?
   * How will potential users find out about your data?
   * With whom will you share the data, and under what conditions?
   * Will you share data via a repository, handle requests directly or use another mechanism?
   * When will you make the data available?
   * Will you pursue getting a persistent identifier for your data?
   * What action will you take to overcome or minimise restrictions?
   * For how long do you need exclusive use of the data and why?
   * Will a data sharing agreement (or equivalent) be required?
7. **[Responsibilities and Resources]({% link pages/data-management/responsibilities-and-resources.md %})** - who will be responsible for data management, what resources do they need, and is any training required?
   * Who is responsible for implementing the DMP, and ensuring it is reviewed and revised?
   * Who will be responsible for each data management activity?
   * How will responsibilities be split across partner sites in collaborative research projects?
   * Will data ownership and responsibilities for RDM be part of any consortium agreement or contract agreed between partners?
   * Is additional specialist expertise (or training for existing staff) required?
   * Do you require hardware or software which is additional or exceptional to existing institutional provision?
   * Will charges be applied by data repositories?
