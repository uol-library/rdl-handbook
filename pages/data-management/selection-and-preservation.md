The **[platform]** will be maintained by the University for a minimum period of **[5 years]** beyond the end of the funded project, although the plan will be to secure future funding to ensure that it has a long-term sustainable future. The costs for doing so will be both infrastructure related (annual costs for providing compute / SAN storage on central University infrastructure) and the staff time to support the platform on a day-to-day basis and manage any operating system upgrades / security patching, etc. 

## RDL (Research Data Leeds Data Archive)

Research data will be deposited the University of Leeds data repository ‘Research Data Leeds’, alongside metadata and documentation to aid discovery and reuse. The data repository is underpinned by a Janet(UK) approved long term data archiving service and data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years beyond the end of the project. [Data will be made openly available under a CC licence] [if there will be an embargo, a difference reuse licence or data access restrictions, describe and justify here]. A unique digital object identifier (DOI) will be created for each deposited dataset.  

Additionally, a metadata entry will be made in the UKDS ReShare repository, linking to the data in Research Data Leeds.

## ESRC: Reshare 

Research data will be offered for inclusion in the UK Data Archive; if not included in UKDA, data will be deposited with the UKDS ReShare self-deposit repository alongside metadata and documentation to aid discovery and reuse and made available to registered users. [If there will be an embargo or data access restrictions, state and justify here]. In addition, a metadata entry will be added to the University of Leeds ‘Research Data Leeds’ service linking to the data in UKDS / ReShare. 

## Preservation Formats

[The Digital Preservation Coalition's Technology Watch publications](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/discover-good-practice/tech-watch-reports) provide authoritative guidance on a variety of digital preservation topics. They include guidance notes on the digital preservation of a wide variety of file formats.

### Video 

For long term preservation of the video data, we will look to use open codecs such as JPEG-2000 (MJ2) in an MXF or AVI wrapper to store the data in the University research data repository. 

### Audio 

The data will be converted to appropriate formats (on the advice of local data management experts) before being submitted to a repository, such as RTF or PDF-A for text documents, JPEG-2000 or TIFF v6 (uncompressed) for digital images and FLAC for audio files.
