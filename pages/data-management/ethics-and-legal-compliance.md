## Intellectual Property (IP) 

The intellectual property of the data generated will remain with the University of Leeds. However, the University policy of the management of research data requires all data arising from research projects to be made openly available where possible. (The research will not use any data which is covered by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 or any other similar legislation.) 

## Sensitive data / data protection 

Any sensitive data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) that is stored on portable electronic devices will be protected by encryption software to FIPS 140-2 standard. Any sensitive data that needs to be transmitted electronically will first be encrypted to FIPS 140-2. 

If any highly sensitive data needs to be stored, then the research data folder on the SAN will be encrypted, so it can only be accessed by authorised members of the project with the appropriate encryption software installed on their desktop PCs. Highly sensitive data is not available from off-campus. 

## Ethics and consent 

The University’s [Informed Consent Protocol](http://ris.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informed_Consent_Protocol.pdf) will be adopted i.e. an aligned participant consent form and information sheet inclusive of the following wording to be added to all consent forms to allow for open data sharing of anonymised data / restricted access to the confidential data as appropriate: “Subject to any data licensing or other contractual restrictions that may apply, as appropriate, I agree for the anonymised research data collected by me to be stored/and or shared for future use”. 

## Anonymization 

Our anonymisation approach will be informed by guidance given in the ICO Anonymization Code of Practice which supports data for controlled access as outlined in the University’s IPP / Suite of Data Safeguards. eg confidential/highly confidential data 

## Record Keeping 

1. Agree and document our research data ownership and dissemination actions  
2. Agree data copyright and license requirements  
3. Contact RIS Legal Services team to formalise these agreements into a data sharing agreement  
4. State collaborative research partner(s) and a data sharing agreement exists your Ethical Review application.    

## Social Media 

The outputs from social media will be assessed for research value; if appropriate, they will be captured, described and deposited for long term access alongside other research outputs from the project. 

## Human participants 

Whilst the data I will be generating is not sensitive in itself, it was originally derived from human participants and so will be processed according to the University’s research data safeguards which are inclusive of the data protection act and the university’s ethical review protocols.  Where project partners exist, I will agree the scope of what data, if any can be shared and what controls might be needed with a view to formalising these arrangements into a partner data sharing agreement. 

## Under 18’s 

Data generated from children, young persons or adults who may or may not be in a vulnerable circumstance will be processed in accordance with the Policy on Safeguarding children, young persons & adults in vulnerable circumstances.  This will ensure appropriate protections are inherent in the dataset. The Policy on Safeguarding children, young persons & adults in vulnerable circumstances is part of the University’s suite of data safeguards that exist to make sure all research data generated in the course of research is appropriately safeguarded.

Please contact your FRIO for further details/policy clarification as required. 

## Consent / Permissions / Rights 

I intend to apply for ethical approval which requires working to the informed consent protocol mandated for research derived from human participants.  This process will include securing consent from research participants for the future re-use and archiving of the research data on completion of the research project.  I will also ensure that where appropriate, correct approvals /permissions / licensing exist to enable re-use of content. 

### Audio recordings / transcripts 

I will ensure prior informed consent/permissions/licensing as appropriate has been secured to allow future dissemination / re-use of recordings (data) from human participants (research team)  

### Using archive materials:  

As I will be using materials that are owned by others - such as scans or photographs of original archive material, I will seek clearance as appropriate from the archive for my planned use of the material within and beyond the project.  I will do this as soon as possible. 

### Sharing archive materials 

For future sharing and reuse I will include metadata/licensing/copyright options as part of the dataset that will advise potential re-users about how / what can be done with said materials. 

### Where the researcher mentions participants or interviewees:  

As you are recording, photographing, and producing transcripts it would be useful to think about and seek consent from your interviewees for your planned use of the files both within your research and for future sharing.  

As you are recording and producing transcripts of interviews it will also be necessary to think about and seek consent from your interviewees for your planned use of the files both within your research and for future sharing. This will include plans for anonymisation and how both the raw and anonymised material will be handled and shared.  

As you are recording and perhaps producing transcripts it would be useful to think about and seek consent from your interviewees or participants for your planned use of the video files and transcripts both within your research and for future sharing. Planning for this early in the project and using a standard consent form if needed will help.  

### Events:  

As you are recording and perhaps producing transcripts of events it would be useful to think about and seek consent from your participants for your planned use of the video files, images and transcripts both within your research and for future sharing. Planning for this early in the project and using a standard consent form if needed will help. Probably a lightweight consent form or signing sheet will do the trick.
