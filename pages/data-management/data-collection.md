## File formats and software

The institutional data repository supports many file formats. However wherever possible, open file formats to support long term reuse and preservation will be used. For example, a very common format for dissemination and an open format for preservation (MP3 and FLAC). 

The UK Data Archive file formats table is a useful:

You may also find [examples from the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html) helpful.

### Accessibility

If data is to be stored in PDF format, care should be taken to ensure the generated files are accessible (see <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf>). Other formats also benefit from the use of specific techniques of authorship to make them more accessible (for example, Microsoft Word - <https://webaim.org/techniques/word/>).

Provision of transcripts / closed captions / subtitles for audio and video content is mandatory to comply with Accessibility regulations (see <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded.html>)

### Nvivo 

The UK Data Service provides [good practice guidelines on data managing using NVivo9](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk//app/uploads/ukda-datamanagement-nvivo.pdf) 

### Software / Code

In order to ensure that software can be effectively supported, it is essential to ensure the following:
* The code is fully commented and written according to appropriate open standards.
* The code is managed using a suitable version control system (e.g. git) with verbose comments so the history of any changes can be tracked.
* All dependencies should be listed with versions.
* No deprecated functions or features are used, and any which could become obsolete within the sustainability period should be avoided where possible. 
* If the software is written to be interoperable with other systems, it should communicate using open standards and protocols.
