## File formats and software

The institutional data repository supports many file formats. However wherever possible, open file formats to support long term reuse and preservation will be used. For example, a very common format for dissemination and an open format for preservation (MP3 and FLAC). 

The UK Data Archive file formats table is a useful:

### Accessibility

If data is to be stored in PDF format, care should be taken to ensure the generated files are accessible (see <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf>). Other formats also benefit from the use of specific techniques of authorship to make them more accessible (for example, Microsoft Word - <https://webaim.org/techniques/word/>).

Provision of transcripts / closed captions / subtitles for audio and video content is mandatory to comply with Accessibility regulations (see <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/captions-prerecorded.html>)

### Nvivo 

NVivo data will be prepared for archiving in accordance with the UKDS guidelines (http://data-archive.ac.uk/media/262066/ukda-datamanagement-nvivo.pdf) 

### Software / Code

In order to ensure that software can be effectively supported, it is essential to ensure the following:
* The code is fully commented and written according to appropriate open standards.
* The code is managed using a suitable version control system (e.g. git) with verbose comments so the history of any changes can be tracked.
* All dependencies should be listed with versions.
* No deprecated functions or features are used, and any which could become obsolete within the sustainability period should be avoided where possible. 
* If the software is written to be interoperable with other systems, it should communicate using open standards and protocols. 

## General Notes

1. All data to be stored in dedicated N: drive research project folder (PI to contact IT at award stage to arrange this). Remote access to data via Citrix Desktop Anywhere portal. Use of University OneDrive cloud storage service is appropriate for situations when it is not possible to save directly to the N: drive (e.g. working away from the University).  
2. Data stored on portable devices will be transferred to N: drive as soon as is practicable bearing in mind the likelihood and impact of loss.  
3. No sensitive data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) will be stored on portable devices (e.g. laptops) unless they are protected by appropriate encryption software which must be arranged through the Faculty IT Manager. <http://goo.gl/2kemW>
4. Data collection will take place within the UK and xxx. No confidential data stored in the UK will need to be transmitted outside the European Economic Area. <http://goog.gl/TTLWA>
5. The project will involve conducting a number of interviews, some of which may be audio-recorded. Interviewees will only be identified by name if they have given their written consent. Where this is not the case, then their full name will not be included in either the interview recording or subsequent transcription.  
6. Any recordings made on a portable device should be deleted as soon as they have been transcribed / copied in a digital audio form to the N: drive folder. It is best practice to use an audio recorder which records to removal media (such as SD cards) and to securely erase these at the end of the project using a utility such as CyberShredder (http://www.cylog.org/files/utilities/cshred112.zip). http://goo.gl/5ItjU  
7. With reference to any conferences, workshops, dissemination events etc. organised as part of this project, if payment is being taken then credit card information must ONLY be processed using a PCI-DSS compliant system. The only permitted options at the University are taking all payments via the conference office or using http://store.leeds.ac.uk (or in exceptional circumstances using a 3rd party PCI-DSS compliant provider, such as WorldPay) Under no circumstances should any card details be collected via a local website.  

Any personal data must be deleted within a reasonable time after the end of the event e.g. 6 weeks It is fine to keep a record of attendance in the form of name, institution only (i.e. no home addresses / phone numbers)  

Any website used to collect personal data (names / addresses etc.) must contain a suitable privacy statement detailing what information is being collected, what it will be used for, when it will be destroyed and what, if any, data will be retained and for what purpose. A sample statement is here, which can be amended to suit. http://www.leeds.ac.uk/privacy
