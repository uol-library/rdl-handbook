The term metadata is often used when referring to data descriptions and documentation. 

Appropriate metadata will be collected (to agreed standards where available) to enable future reuse of the data. 

Advice on metadata is available from the University of Leeds Research Data Management team. Any data stored and shared through the University data repository will be described using Dublin Core and DataCite metadata schemas. All datasets are assigned a unique digital object identifier (DOI). Data will be made available alongside contextual documentation to aid reuse. 

## Music 

In terms of metadata, we will record basic DataCite / Dublin Core metadata for the purposes of resource discovery. Schemas such as MPEG-7, SMPTE and VideoMD are too technically focussed to be of real benefit to this project. In the Music schema arena, FreeDB and MusicBrainz are really too focussed on recorded music, not live performances. It is likely that we will be able to use elements of the Music Ontology (http://musicontology.com/) as a standard vocabulary for describing music performances
