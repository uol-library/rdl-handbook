## EU H2020 /F9

The project will automatically be part of the EU open data pilot. Projects are asked to submit a data management plan (DMP) within the first 6 months of the project and update the plan during the course of the project. 

It is possible to opt out of the open data pilot. Projects that opt out are still encouraged to submit a DMP on a voluntary basis. The DMP headings and guidance are online here (see Annex 1 for the DMP template):
