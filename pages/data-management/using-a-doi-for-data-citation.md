Your data will be treated like other types of publication. It can generate citations and be allocated a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

A DOI is a unique string of characters that provides a persistent link for your data. All data repositories should be able to provide a persistent identifier, which is usually a DOI.

### Generate a DOI for your data
You can generate a DOI for your research data from the [Research Data Leeds repository](https://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk).

Fill in this form with information about your research data and any significant deadlines (if you are publishing a paper). We aim to allocate a DOI within two working days.

### Provide a data DOI when you publish
Include your data DOI(s) in your published work. DOIs should always be expressed as a clickable link in the form (**doi:10.1234/abcd**) or a full URL (**https<nolink>://doi.org/10.1234/abcd**).

### DOI numbers broken down
A DOI number begins with a 10 and contain a prefix and suffix separated by a slash.

The British Library allocates the prefix before the forward slash, which indicates the data host or organisation.

The suffix is controlled by the data host.
