The University provides [information and guidance on good practice in ethics and ethical review](https://ris.leeds.ac.uk/research-ethics-and-integrity/ethics-and-ethical-review/).

##  Ethical Review & IT Assurance

As you are dealing with data undergoing ethical review, your data is best classified according to the [Turing Classification model](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11815224.v4).

All projects that have data classified as either Tier 3 or 4 are guided to the university facilities for storing data during your research project and advice on security measures such as using encryption, particularly useful if you are gathering information in the field.

Examples of how commonly used data is classified can be found in the University’s [Information Management Guide](https://dataprotection.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2019/05/Information-Management-Guide.pdf) and further details are available in the [Information Protection Policy](https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&sys_id=6038bfbc0fae728089d7f55be1050e9d).

If you have further questions in this area, please contact:

## Consent, Contractual, Legal Agreements

* A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a GDPR requirement used to identify and minimize the data protection risks in your data including that relating to any non-UK fieldwork locations.  It is important that you contact the University Secretariat - [A.C.Temple@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:A.C.Temple@leeds.ac.uk) - to confirm requirements in relation to this.
* If the project is using any data generated by someone else, establish permission early in the project, both for use by the project and for sharing, during and beyond the term of the project - to include securing agreement from the copyright holder/ explain to the copyright holder how you intend to further share the data.
* Consent should be sought from all participants at the earliest opportunity. All plans for the data should cover all the ways you plan to handle data pre, during and post project. This should include storing/sharing in an anonymised form. Any data retention intentions post project, regardless of duration should include plans for data deposit/sharing in a trusted/archive or repository. Our team can advise you further on this.
* For data planned to be stored and shared on a restricted basis eg for research purposes only, our suggested consent wording would be _“I agree for the data collected from me to be stored and used in relevant future research in an anonymised/pseudonymised form”_.
* For data planned to be stored and shared more openly, eg more publicly, our suggested consent wording would be _“I understand that the research data, which will be anonymized (not linked to me), may be shared publicly for future use”_.
* 'Technical', 'Sharing' and 'Processing’ data agreements, consent, permission, or arrangement re data transfer/sharing between UoL and any project partners either in/out of the UK, should always be formalized with the support of the University's [RIS Contracts Team](http://ris.leeds.ac.uk/info/29/contracts_and_grant_t_and_cs/29/meet_the_legal_services_team). This will best ensure all research partners are able to legally undertake associated data-related research activity in the short, medium, and longer-term. 

## Permissions for secondary use of data by you

Publicly available data does not automatically come with permission for you to reuse and share and you may still need a secured agreement from the copyright holder following explanation to the copyright holder about how you intend to further share the data. For any data used that cannot be shared further, ensure full bibliographic citations are included in any of your research outputs, to enable other researchers to find the material you have used in your research. 

## Licensing

If you are intending to make your data available for public use, consider which type of license would be appropriate. Most datasets in the Research Data Leeds repository have a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), or an [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for software. Other licenses are available, and we can provide advice on your options.
