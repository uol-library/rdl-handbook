### Transfer data into University storage

You'll often need to use laptops, tablets, and mobile phones when you are travelling or undertaking research in the field. It's also increasingly common to capture data using cameras or audio recorders.

Data captured off campus is less secure and so it is important that you transfer it into University storage.

The University has three managed and supported drives – M: drive (personal), N:drive (shared) and OneDrive–University of Leeds (cloud-based). As there is a greater risk of loss when using your own devices, you should transfer any data generated in the field to these drives as soon as possible.

Transcribe or copy any recordings made on a portable device. 

You should then preferably delete them.

### Store your data on encrypted devices

No sensitive data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) should be stored on laptops unless they are protected by appropriate encryption software. You can arrange this through the IT team.

USB storage devices should also be encrypted where you are handling sensitive data files.

It may be appropriate to purchase an encrypted audio recorder where you are conducting interviews.
