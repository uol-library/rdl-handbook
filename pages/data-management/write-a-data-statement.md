Your funder or publisher may expect you to include a data statement in any published papers. This statement should state how and where others can access the data underpinning the paper.

Your submitted manuscript should include a clearly labelled statement before the acknowledgements. The exact format and placement of the data statement will be influenced by a journal’s house style but generally any statement should include:

access to data, usually through a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
any terms of use, such as embargos, licences, data sharing agreements
You might want to format your statement as a data citation or a simple statement, such as: "The data associated with this paper are openly available from the University of Leeds Data Repository. http<nolink>://doi.org/10.5518/5678abcd.”

Please note that an invitation to “contact the author” for the data will not meet research funder expectations.

No associated or additional data
For articles which have no associated data, the statement should read:

*“No data are associated with this article.”*

For articles where all associated data are presented in the article itself, please include the statement:

*“All data underlying the results are available as part of the article and no additional source data are required.”*
