## Plans for Sharing - collaboration

To support our collaborative activities we plan to: 

To ensure data management, dissemination and clarity of roles exists within the project in the short, medium and long term, a formal agreement will be drawn up between project partner(s) / collaborators to include: 

* Agree and document research data ownership and dissemination actions  
* Agree data copyright and license requirements  
* Contact with RIS Legal Services to formalise negotiated positions and activity into a data sharing agreement  
* Confirm the research collaborative arrangements in the Ethical Review application including that a data sharing agreement exists

## Plans for sharing - repository

Data from the project will be offered to the University of Leeds Research Data Repository or another appropriate data repository service in order to ensure the data can be shared, reused and cited beyond the end of the project. 

At the beginning of the project, advice will be sought from the University's Research Data team and a data management plan for the project will be developed. Research data will be deposited in the University of Leeds data repository, alongside metadata and documentation to aid discovery and reuse. The data repository is underpinned by a Janet(UK) approved long term data archiving service and data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years beyond the end of the project. Data will be made openly available after an appropriate embargo period [give justification, including information about patenting]. A unique digital object identifier (DOI) will be created for each deposited dataset.  

The data generated and collected as part of this project will be stored in open formats wherever practicable and deposited in the University research data repository, where it will be preserved for the long term (10 years+). The data in the repository will also have a sufficient level of metadata associated with it to aid discovery and will be exposed using open protocols such as OAI-PMH as well as being discoverable by search engines such as Google. 

I will maximise the impact of my research by ensuring data generated from my research is made as openly discoverable and accessible as possible via multiple dissemination routes. To achieve this ‘consent /permission/right to archive’ will be built into participant research information and consent processes.  In addition consent forms and project information sheets and any agreements/contractual documentation will address data sharing/storage/archiving explicitly. 

## RADAR

Restricted access data deposited with the University of Leeds data repository will be managed according to the University’s Research Data Access Governance and Escalation Model. Potential users will apply for access, stating their intended use. If successful, access will be subject to a data reuse agreement.

Consent: I agree for selected anonymised/pseudonymised research data collected to be stored/and or shared for future use.
