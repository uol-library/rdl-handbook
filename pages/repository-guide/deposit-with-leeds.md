The University of Leeds has a data repository for open data sharing.
 
<http://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/>

There is also a closed access repository called RADAR (Restricted Access DAta Repository) for material which can be shared but only with controls applied. Typically this will be data sourced from human participants or other data with sensitivities and restrictions. See the [RADAR](https://handbook.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/repository-guide/radar/) page for more details.

A guide to the Deposit process with links to relevant forms and templates is available on the Research Data Leeds website:

We encourage researchers who are new to depositing and sharing data to start with two questions 
 
* If someone reads my paper or dissertation what data would they need to have available in order to be able to  validate my findings or conclusions? 
* Is any of the data I have collected of intrinsic value - perhaps because of the uniqueness of a situation or event, the scarcity of the sample tested or the very high cost associated with the data collection? 
 
If your data goes through a complex processing chain, answering these questions will also help you to decide which data stages will be of most value and reuse potential. You may even discover someone wants to collaborate with you because of the data.

If you are uncertain whether your data is suitable for sharing, or whether the data is more suitable for the open repository or RADAR, please contact the Research Data Leeds team for advice <researchdataleeds@leeds.ac.uk>

## Deposit timeline

The first step is to give us some basic information about the data you want to deposit and share. 
 
We will then 
* set up a folder for you to deposit your data 
* in that folder we will provide you with an excel file to with some of your dataset details filled in already 
* a guidance document on how to fill in the rest of the details 
* allocate a DOI for the dataset 
 
You will then 
* complete the rest of the details in the excel file 
* add your data files to the deposit folder - ideally keep your files to 2GB or smaller and use filenames with no spaces
* include the citation to the dataset with DOI in the publication if you are preparing one 
 
We will then 
* check the details in the spreadsheet 
* check the files 
* deposit your data in our "review" repository 
 
You will then  
* check that the dataset looks OK in "Review" 
* confirm that we can move the dataset to the permanent repository 
 
We will then 
* move the dataset to the permanent repository 
* mint the DOI
