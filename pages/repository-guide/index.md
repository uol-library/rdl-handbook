_Either_ to underpin a research publication  

_Or_ Because of the intrinsic value of the data  

It is your decision what makes up the 'dataset' associated with your published paper. Here's an example:  

<http://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/2/>

You can see that as well as data files, the record contains links to associated resources - in this case, a related publication and some software deposited in another repository (Zenodo). In your case, you could deposit whatever files you feel are useful to support your associated paper, and we could add a link (or links) to the bulk of the data in the UK Data Service. Does each of the datasets you have used in the UK Data Service have its own DOI? We could link to multiple DOIs from the Leeds data repository record if this is useful.  

## Expectations and Principles

The expectation is that where the findings in your paper are supported by data you should make that data available and include a statement in the paper about where the data can be found, preferably with a DOI ([Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)).  

Research data can be a primary research output in its own right. It is expected that this data will be shared as openly as possible, citable with a permanent identifier such as a DOI, and be stored with metadata and sufficient contextual information to support discovery and reuse.  

> “As open as possible, as closed as necessary”
