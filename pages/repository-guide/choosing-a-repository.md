You have several choices when it is time to deposit your data. Which repository you decide to use will be informed by who your funder is, what they require, and the reputation of the repository.

For information about choosing a repository for Open Research data, please see our [Open Research section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/open-research/choosing-repository.md %})

If your funder has specified a particular repository, then you should deposit your data with the recommended service. The [SHERPA JULIET database](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/){:target="_blank"} provides a summary of the data archiving policies of several funders.

Deposit your data in our [Research Data Leeds repository]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/repository-guide/deposit-with-leeds.md %}) if your research is funded by any of the UK Research Councils (but ESRC funded data should be offered to the UK Data Archive and NERC data to the Environmental Data Service in the first instance), Wellcome Trust, CRUK or Horizon 2020, or any other funder and they have not specified another repository. If you have data which cannot be shared openly, deposit it in [RADAR]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/repository-guide/radar.md %}).

## Is your data already in another repository?

If your data is already available in the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/{:target="_blank"}), there is no need to deposit it again with the Research Data Leeds repository. Make sure there is a citation to the data in the UK Data Service in your paper References list.

## Repository for code 

You can choose where to deposit, but we suggest that you choose a repository that can give you a permanent, unique and resolvable identifier (like a DOI) for your code. We generally advise [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) because it has a relationship with the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/){:target="_blank"} which will assign a DOI for your code. The DOI (or other permanent link) makes the code more readily citable:

<https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/>
 
We can then include the DOI (or other link) to the code in the dataset record or the thesis record in White Rose Etheses Online so that anyone finding your data /reading your thesis has an easy link to the code in GitHub/Zenodo (or wherever you have deposited). 
 
You should consider what licence you will apply to your code. If we make code available in one of our Leeds repositories, such as the research data repository, we generally use an MIT Licence (also known as the expat licence) which is a very open, liberal licence <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT> - but the choice of licence is yours. 

## NERC 

Data from NERC funded projects should be offered to a NERC data centre in the first instance. NERC take most of the data - though there has been at least one datasets with multiple funders and from a none core subject area where NERC have been happy for the data to come to the Research Data Leeds repository. 

Environmental data which is not NERC funded - NERC will consider taking it but will weigh up the size and the complexity of adding the data to their collection. If in doubt, contact the relevant NERC data centre or email the data centre coordinator <data@nerc.ukri.org>
