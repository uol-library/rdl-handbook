## NERC
Data from NERC funded projects should be offered to one of the NERC data centres which make up the [NERC Environmental Data Service](https://eds.ukri.org/environmental-data-service) in the first instance. NERC take most of the data - though there has been at least one datasets with multiple funders and from a none core subject area where NERC have been happy for the data to come to the Research Data Leeds repository.

Environmental data which is not NERC funded: NERC will consider taking it but will weigh up the size and the complexity of adding the data to their collection. If in doubt, contact the relevant NERC data centre or email the data centre coordinator <data@nerc.ukri.org>
