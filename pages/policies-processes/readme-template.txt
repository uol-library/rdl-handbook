[This template readme file should be edited to be relevant to your dataset. The template proposes a basic set of information to be provided about a dataset. Sections 1-3 provide key information about the dataset and should be completed as fully as possible; Sections 4-5 provide information for interpretation and use of the dataset, and should be completed according to your judgement. Ask yourself in completing these sections: what information would the user of this dataset need in order to be able to understand it or replicate the results?

Use of the README plain text format for dataset documentation is not required, and may not be suitable for longer or more detailed documentation. In these cases, or if preferred, you can use PDF or MS Word.

Information provided here must correspond accurately with information provided in the dataset metadata record, e.g. the dataset title should match exactly, the same Creators should be listed, etc.

The readme file should be saved with the name README_[Creator surname]_[Publication year]. The file name should not exceed 32 characters. Examples: README_Smith_2022.txt; README_Jones-etal_2022.txt.

Text within square brackets is instructional and should be deleted from the final version of the readme.]

1. ABOUT THE DATASET
--------------------

Title:	

Creator(s): [Enter names of dataset Creators and add reference numbers to correspond with named Organisations if necessary, e.g.: Ben Jones[1], Alice Smith[2]]

Organisation(s): [Enter names of organisations with which creators are affiliated. Add reference numbers if necessary to correspond to relevant Creators' names, e.g. 1. University of Leeds. 2. University of York]

Rights-holder(s):

Publication Year:

Description: [Abstract or brief description of the Dataset. Do not copy the abstract of an associated paper. The description should provide brief summary information about the content of the dataset, e.g.: a description of the data, how they were collected/generated, key characteristics, etc. sufficient to give someone landing on the metadata record a basic understanding of what the data are and their possible relevance or use.]

Cite as: [Indicate how the dataset should be cited. The Archive's default citation format is: [Creators] ([Publication year]): [Title]. University of Leeds. [Dataset] [DOI], e.g. Radajewski, Dimitry and Meldrum, Fiona (2021) Dataset for 'An Innovative Data Processing Method for Studying Nanoparticle Formation in Droplet Microfluidics using X-rays Scattering'. University of Leeds. [Dataset] https://doi.org/10.5518/1013. Note that although the DOI will not be assigned until the dataset is published in the Archive, once you have started a deposit, a DOI will be reserved based on the item ID in the database. In the example cited, the item ID is 1013. The preceding string is always the same. If your item ID is 999, the DOI will be https://doi.org/10.5518/999.] 

Related publication: [Provide a citation for any article reporting results based on analysis of the dataset. Direct links to related publications can also be added to the Related resources and Associated CentAUR publications fields in the metadata record. If a publication is in preparation at the time of deposit, provide relevant details where known (authors, title, journal, year, etc.) and indicate status at time of deposit (Submitted; In preparation; Accepted).]

Contact: [This is optional. If you wish, enter a contact email or other details for a corresponding Creator.]

3. PROJECT AND FUNDING INFORMATION
----------------------------------

Title: [title of project]

Dates: [project start-end]

Funding organisation: 

Grant no.:

[Include in this section acknowledgements of all relevant funding sources, including e.g. public and charitable funders, industrial sponsors, and the University. If the dataset was not generated as part of a specific project or with dedicated project funding, you can say e.g. 'This dataset was not created in the course of a funded project.']


4. CONTENTS
-----------
File listing

[List by file or folder name and provide brief descriptions of file or folder contents. If files are numerous, provide a key to the dataset structure/relationship between files, and the file naming convention. Files of the same type should be consistently named using a standard syntax where possible.

Include information about specialised data file formats, and software used to generate/required to render data files (including version and links where relevant).

If relevant, include here any codebook or data dictionary for the dataset or constituent files, providing the following information as required:

- Number of variables 
- Number of cases/rows 
- List of variables, containing variable name(s), description(s), unit(s)and value labels as appropriate for each
- Missing data codes, listing code and definition
- Specialized formats or other abbreviations used.] 


5. METHODS
----------

[This section should describe how the dataset was generated. The following information should be included as relevant:

- Experimental procedures/protocols.
- Environmental/experimental conditions, including information such as geographic location and dates of data collection or temporal range covered, as relevant.
- Instruments used, both hardware and software, with specification of version, setup, standards, calibration, etc.
- Methods used for processing the data, e.g. to clean, transform, quality-assure and analyse data. If software has been used, include name and version of software, and any packages or libraries needed to run scripts. Any code written to process/analyse data should be described and archived with the dataset or made accessible by other means. 
- If data have been processed from existing sources, citations/links to the sources used.
- People or organisations not named as dataset Creators but involved in its production or use in some way, along with information about their role, e.g. PhD Supervisor or person involved in study design, survey service provider that distributed survey and collected responses, co-authors of related paper who contributed to data analysis.
- If detailed information about methods is available in an article that has been published or is due to be published, this can be referred to and full details of methods omitted here. If the article has already been fully referenced as the Related publication in Section 1 above, a brief citation will be sufficient here.]
