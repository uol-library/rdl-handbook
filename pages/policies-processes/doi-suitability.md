## Is this 'thing' suitable to have a DOI?

A DOI can be allocated to any object or collection of objects – digital or physical – but must always be associated with an online landing page describing the associated object(s).  

A DOI is not time limited; once it has been registered, it should always point to an appropriate landing page. 

To be allocated a Leeds University Library managed DOI the following criteria must be met:  

* the item should not already have a DOI or likely to be getting one from another source – any exceptions will be considered by Research Data Leeds on a case by case basis  
* the associated item must be deposited in one of the digital repositories managed by Leeds University Library or the landing page for the DOI must be managed by Leeds University Library or the landing page must be managed by a ‘DOI trusted partner’ (see below) at the University of Leeds e.g. ForestPlots 
* the mandatory metadata for the DOI should be releasable under a CC0 licence (required by our agreement with the British Library Board)  
* there must be some type of content associated with the DOI – a digital file(s), a physical entity  
* the work must have 'citation potential' (required by DataCite and BL <https://www.bl.uk/datacite/become-a-datacite-uk-client>) 
* the associated content must have reached a level of completion or stasis; once registered, the mandatory metadata fields cannot be changed  
* the associated content must have passed through the RDL screening process (whatever we agree that to be) 
* someone must click through the RDL Deposit Agreement
* there must be sufficient resource either within the Leeds University Library or other agreed administrating body to manage the DOIs and associated landing pages.  

**What about policy documents, working papers, posters etc?**

* These will be considered case by case. Do we have the resource to process the requests? How many works are we talking about? Manage expectations - we don’t issues DOIs as routine practice. 
* Most 'publication' type material should be deposited via Symplectic to WRRO e.g. working papers, policy documents, reports 
* The DOI is associated with the WRRO landing page for the item. 
* RDL may need to make the material live (rather than Research Support) because it may have low priority but we need to 'jump the queue' in order to mint the DOI 
* Check whether the work is going to be published elsewhere and whether it is likely to get a DOI when published - ideally a specific work should have just one DOI. 
* Like data DOIs, DOIs can be 'allocated' for inclusion in a document / resource on the understanding that the associated material will be deposited. 

For 'publication type' works, the DOI sequence (on the DOI spreadsheet) is: 

https://doi.org/10.5518/100/ 

Format variations exist, but after discussion we decided the /100/ will indicate a 'publication type' work.

## DOI trusted partner  

DOI Trusted Partner status with the University Library is required if (i) an entity requires a dedicated prefix for their collection or (ii) if the landing pages associated with the DOI are not managed by the University Library. DOI Trusted Partners must enter into an agreement with the Leeds University Library which guarantees:  
* the DOI landing pages will be managed in an appropriate way to enable Leeds University Library to fulfil its obligations to the British Library laid out in the DOI Allocation Agreement  
* DOI landing pages will be maintained long term  
* arrangements for DOI landing page management will be made in the case the DOI Trusted Partner ceases to exist  
* long term curatorial arrangements are in place for any materials or data objects described on the DOI landing page  
* in cases where Leeds University Library administers the DOI but does not control the landing page, the Library will be notified in good time of any landing page URL changes.
