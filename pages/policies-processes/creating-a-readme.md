## Readme for Data and Software 

To improve the availability and reproducibility of work published, authors are required by publishers to specify the availability of data, computational models, code, and other electronic materials used in work submitted for publication. This requirement is intended to:   

1. make it easier for readers and others to use, reproduce, and extend published work;  
2. increase the quality of submissions; and   
3. further encourage people to use and cite published work and is a step forward to allow readers, authors, and those in the field to practice more open and reproducible science.  

An example of a policy describing these requirement is available here:

<https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29WR.1943-5452.0000998>

A README template with accompanying notes is available here:

[University of Leeds README template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/policies-processes/readme-template.txt %})

### File formats

Provide directions for how to open the files in the dataset.

If they are not common file format:

* Do you need specific software to open the files?
* Does this software require a license?
* Do you need a specific version of the software?
* Does the software have particular requirements (platform, hardware, etc.)?

In addition to the Information sheet (or as part of it), provide directions that describe the steps taken/work flow used to organize the materials and post process results.

Describe the workflow so it starts with the raw model results, then works through to the results presented in paper figures and tables.  

Please explain the contents of the data, eg. incluse units of measurement where values are presented in numeric formats.

Does the material include the code/scripts used to clean the raw data and prepare it for modeling? Even if you canâ€™t deposit the raw data, please share the scripts developed that processed and prepared the data for use eg in modeling.

## Anonymisation

Does this supplemental material include an anonymous version of the raw data?   

If yes, that would be super and the documentation should highlight this.   

If not, an anonymous version of the dataset (disaggregated down to whatever level the data sharing agreement allows).
