# University of Leeds Jekyll Theme

Jekyll theme based on the [University of Leeds Design System](https://designsystem.leeds.ac.uk).

## Theme features

The theme contains layouts for [Pages and Posts](https://github.com/universityofleeds/jekyll-theme-uol/wiki/Pages-and-Posts), and a special layout for [home pages and landing pages](https://github.com/universityofleeds/jekyll-theme-uol/wiki/Home-page). The home page layout includes various widgets to showcase areas of the site, list recent posts and create calls to action. The theme also includes a number of [components](https://github.com/universityofleeds/jekyll-theme-uol/wiki/Components) which can be used to simplify adding complex content such as quotations, accordions and tables.

The [University of Leeds Design System](https://designsystem.leeds.ac.uk) contains multiple [menu systems](https://github.com/universityofleeds/jekyll-theme-uol/wiki/Menus) and areas on pages which can be configured to appear sitewide, in groups of pages, or on single pages using [YAML front matter and data files](https://github.com/universityofleeds/jekyll-theme-uol/wiki/YAML-Basics). The design was built to cater for a large amount of content.
